# Flow onboarding - Route B: backfill / migration

Adopting Flow into an **existing** repo that already has history, code, CI of its own, a
populated CLAUDE.md, and probably a tracker (Linear/Jira/issues/markdown lists). This route adds
a migration prefix to the clean route (steps 1-4 below); from step 5 it converges with INIT.md.

Generalized from the first real migration (the canary repo). The placeholders `<TRACKER>`, `<ID-PREFIX>`,
`<app-dir>`, `<other-runtime-dir>` mark what changes per project; the lessons are baked in - they
each cost a detour the first time and shouldn't again.

Run as the orchestrator (Cowork) + human GitHub steps. The retrofit commits go **straight to
`main`**: this is the genesis of the store (the same exemption as task-state commits, and the
store-guard would otherwise block its own birth PR). No application code changes in the retrofit.

## 0. Preconditions

- Clean working tree on `main`, fetched and up to date. Anything dirty/unpushed -> stop, ask.
- Note any in-flight branches/PRs - they keep working; the retrofit doesn't touch them.

## 1. Overlay the Flow files (merge, don't clobber)

Copy from `project-template/`: `.flow/` (config, `PROTOCOL.md`, _TEMPLATE, board, `VERSION`,
**all of** `bin/`), both host pointers (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` — see step 3),
`.github/workflows/flow-*.yml` (thin callers of canonical's reusable workflows — see
`docs/flow-reusable-workflows.md` in the flow repo), and **merge** `.claude/` (agents + skills)
into any existing `.claude/` - list collisions first; if a same-named file differs, stop and show
the human. Append `.flow/board-edits.json` to `.gitignore`; add the `.gitattributes` entries.

## 2. Calibrate `.flow/config.yml`

Same as INIT.md step 2, against the real repo:
- `project.name` = `<ID-PREFIX>` (keep continuity with the old tracker's ids if migrating one).
- Five commands. **Monorepo note:** if code lives in `<app-dir>/`, prefix commands (`cd <app-dir> && ...`).
- **`source_roots`** - declare EVERY runtime. The dangerous case is a second tree (edge functions,
  a worker, a second language in `<other-runtime-dir>/`) the main build never parses. Add a parse
  check per tree (e.g. `deno check <other-runtime-dir>/**/*.ts`).
- `coverage_min` - measure, set floor at measured-minus-margin. **Lockfile stacks:** after adding
  any dev dep (e.g. a coverage provider), regenerate the lockfile **on the CI platform** (Linux)
  and run the strict install once before committing - a half-updated or wrong-platform lock passes
  locally but fails the gate's `npm ci`.
- `security.focus` from the codebase's actual scars (read the existing CLAUDE.md / incident notes).

## 3. Add the protocol pointer, keep the project knowledge  [STOP for human approval]

**There is no protocol merge any more.** The protocol arrives as its own file, `.flow/PROTOCOL.md`,
in step 1. The existing CLAUDE.md is dense project knowledge and it stays that way — you are adding
a pointer to it, not folding a second document into it:

1. **Add the import to the existing `CLAUDE.md`.** A line reading `@.flow/PROTOCOL.md`, on its own,
   outside backticks and outside any code fence (Claude Code skips both when parsing imports). Put
   it near the top so the protocol is in context before the project's own rules qualify it.
2. **Add `AGENTS.md`** from the template if the repo has none, or add the same plain-English
   "read `.flow/PROTOCOL.md` first" instruction to the top of the existing one. That convention has
   no import mechanism, so the instruction is the whole mechanism.
3. Keep the project's rules / routing / implementation notes exactly where they are. Do not adapt
   the protocol per project — id prefix and monorepo command notes belong in `.flow/config.yml`
   and in the project notes, not in a forked copy of the protocol.
4. **Shipped-state tables** (deployed components, build status) -> point to wherever the project's
   manifest/source-of-truth lives; don't duplicate. In-flight work -> `.flow/tasks/` + issues.
5. **Hard size budget: <= 25k chars** (`wc -c CLAUDE.md`). Past ~40k, Claude Code truncates the
   tail and every session pays the tax. Move per-version changelogs / long notes into a manifest
   or architecture doc and leave summaries + pointers. The protocol no longer counts against this
   budget, so the whole allowance is available for real project knowledge.

Verify the pointer resolved before you call this done — it fails silently otherwise:

```bash
grep -qx '@.flow/PROTOCOL.md' CLAUDE.md && test -f .flow/PROTOCOL.md && echo "pointer OK"
```

Present the diff + final char count. **Wait for approval before committing.**

## 4. Migrate the existing tracker

- **In-flight items** -> ready task files in `.flow/tasks/` (apply the readiness bar; the old
  ticket is raw material, not a spec). Preserve original ids as the task id where it aids continuity.
- **Backlog / raw ideas** -> GitHub **issues** (the capture inbox); triage turns them into tasks.
  Pull FULL descriptions across **before** decommissioning `<TRACKER>` - its URLs die with it.
- **Done / obsolete** -> archive list / close; don't migrate.
- Export a backup of `<TRACKER>` for the historical record, then downgrade/cancel it later.

## 5-8. Converge with the clean route (see INIT.md)

From here the routes are identical:
- **5. Stack-specific CI line** in flow-gates.yml; **set board REPO**.
- **6. Gate-green the baseline FIRST** - run the full gate on `main` and fix all latent infra debt
  in ONE pass (lockfile, lint config, undeclared source_roots, Node version) *before* the first
  task. On an existing repo this is where the debt lives; do not let the first task discover it
  one red CI run at a time.
- **7. Register with the global flightdeck** - append to `flightdeck/projects.yml`. Also copy in
  `.claude/settings.json` (the `extraKnownMarketplaces` pointer to the private Flow plugin) and run
  `claude plugin install flow@flow`, so Cowork/orchestrator sessions can drive this repo. The worker
  needs nothing - it runs the gate from the repo's committed `.claude/`; the plugin only registers
  `task-writer`/`board-builder`/`portfolio-manager` for Cowork, which doesn't auto-discover repo skills.
- **8. Run the loop** - manual one-liner, or enable `FLOW_AI` + token for triage/review/queue-runner.

## Sunset checklist (migration only)

- Every open `<TRACKER>` item exists as a task or an issue (spot-check a couple of detailed ones).
- Old work-tracking docs archived; misfiled files relocated.
- `<TRACKER>` exported, then downgraded.
- The board reflects reality (regenerate with board-builder).
